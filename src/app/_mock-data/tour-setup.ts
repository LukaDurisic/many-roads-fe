          "Let us take you to \"Shui Hang Hau,\" which means 'Mouth of a Waterfall' in Cantonese. You might think the name is more befitting of a quiet Chinese fishing village, but this street in Sheung Wan holds the historical origin of Hong Kong’s modern history.\n\nOn January 26, 1841, British troops landed here, raised the Union Jack, and officially claimed Hong Kong Island in the name of Queen Victoria II. Back then, this area had a waterfall connected to what is now Hollywood Road. The water from the stream was fresh and sweet, serving as a vital source for the locals.\n\nThis water supply, along with its accessibility, led the British to establish a military camp nearby at Possession Point—now Hollywood Road Park. They named the adjacent road 'Possession Street,' which became the very first north-south street in the City of Victoria.\n\nAs the city expanded and reclaimed land, Possession Street lost its waterfront access and transformed into a red-light district where upscale brothels flourished. In the late Qing Dynasty, when the reformist Kang Youwei fled China for Hong Kong, he reportedly visited a prostitute here and even composed a poem about the encounter.\n\nToday, the waterfall that once tumbled down the slope is long gone, buried under urban development. But rainwater still flows through a covered nullah from Victoria Peak to the sea. On quiet, rainy nights, when the streets are empty, you might still hear the soft gurgle of water—a haunting echo of the past.\n\nPossession Street, just 150 meters long, symbolizes Hong Kong’s incredible rise over 150 years from a humble fishing village to a vibrant, modern financial center.

          "Chu Wing Kee is a household goods store established in 1959. It might not be a century-old brand just yet, but it holds a significant place in Hong Kong’s cultural landscape. It's more than just a popular spot for trendy locals and tourists to take selfies, hunt for treasures, or just kill time. The store is a treasure trove of nostalgia, filled with plastic piggy banks (sadly not for sale,) rooster bowls, iron mailboxes, 'watermelon' balls, and much more, offering vivid collages of life in Hong Kong in the 1960s to the 1990s.\n\nNow managed by the second-generation owner, the store has become a must-visit for those seeking a slice of Hong Kong’s past. While many hipsters enjoy browsing without making a purchase, if you’re a tourist, don’t hesitate to chat with the friendly owner. Share your budget and preferences, and he’ll guide you to the perfect memento. For example, with just HK$100, he might recommend a small toy from the 1980s—a perfect souvenir packed with sentimental value. At first glance, it may seem like he’s simply selling household goods, but he’s really offering nostalgia. His thoughtful recommendations ensure visitors leave with more than JUST souvenirs - they leave with memories of Hong Kong’s good old days.",

          "As you head east along the Lower Lascar Row Footbridge, you’ll find yourself in the historic Lascar Rows. The term 'Lascar' comes from colonial times and refers to Indian sailors. Back then, most Hong Kong Chinese called Indians by the term 'Morramen' (or 'Moloh' in Cantonese.) This word has its roots in ancient Islamic traders, including Farbas, who had great influence in Hong Kong. It's important to note that 'Morramen' wasn’t intended as a racial slur but a term tied to history and trade.\n\nWhen the British began colonizing new territories in the Far East, they brought many Indian sailors and soldiers. In Hong Kong’s early days, Indian police officers were employed to control the local Chinese population, earning them the name 'Moloh Cha,' or Morramen Officers. Many Indians settled around Possession Point, the site of the British military camp. Today, the area’s street names—Possession Street, Lascar Rows, Upper Station Street, and Sai Ying Pun (Western Army Camp)—reflect its military significance in the past.\n\nDuring the British wars with China in the late Qing Dynasty, the British army looted countless cultural relics. Indian soldiers also took part in this plundering. Locals began calling Lascar Row 'Cat Street' because stolen goods were referred to as 'rat goods,' and those who came to hunt them were nicknamed 'cats.'\n\nBy the 1970s, urban renewal reshaped this area. The new Lok Ku Road split Lascar Rows into two pedestrian-only roads. Upper Lascar Row retained its charm as a bustling market for antiquities. Today, it’s a treasure trove that still attracts many foreign tourists looking for unique finds. While many visitors enjoy browsing, most just leave with small trinkets as memorable souvenirs without real treasures.\n\n(When you're tired of treasure hunting, take a break at \"Halfway Coffee\" and enjoy delicious coffee in retro Chinese-style porcelain cups. )",

          "True to its name ('樓梯' means steps, not ladder, in Cantonese,) Ladder Street is a street made entirely of stone steps. It’s a Grade I historic structure that stretches from Queen's Road Central up to Caine Road in the Mid-Levels. Along the way, you’ll find many historical landmarks, including the iconic Man Mo Temple, the Hong Kong Museum of Medicine, calligraphy stalls, and specialty shops.\n\nIn recent years, Ladder Street has become a popular tourist spot and a backdrop for bridal photoshoots. The charm doesn’t stop at the main street—wander into the connecting side alleys, and you’ll likely stumble upon delightful surprises. You could easily spend an entire day here exploring, shopping, and soaking in the atmosphere.\n\nBack in the early days of British colonial rule, apartheid policies were in place. The mountainous areas of the Mid-Levels were reserved exclusively for the Western community, and Chinese residents were prohibited from living there. Except for service staff, Chinese access stopped at the top of Ladder Street’s 316 stone steps at Caine Road.\n\nThis racial ceiling was eventually broken through by Sir Robert Ho Tung Bosman, a prominent comprador in Hong Kong. Born to a Caucasian father and a Chinese mother, he became the first non-Westerner allowed to build a home in the Mid-Levels. His mansion, known as the Red House, stood where the residential complex Hong Kong Garden now sits—just beside the end of Ladder Street on Caine Road.",

          "The Man Mo Temple has long been the foundation of Hong Kong’s Chinese community. While its exact construction date is uncertain, it’s believed to predate the British occupation. Around 1847, local leaders expanded the temple to honor two deities: Wenchang (文昌), the God of Literacy, and Guan Gong (關公), the Emperor of War. The temple complex includes the Man Mo Temple, Lie Sheng Palace, and the Public Office.\n\nDuring the early days of British rule, Chinese residents had little access to community facilities or public services—except, ironically, the Victoria Gaol. The Man Mo Temple fills the void by serving as more than just a place of worship. It became a multi-purpose hub for public forums, medical aid, and education, combining politics, legal services, and social welfare under one roof. In fact, the temple’s social role was so integral that its reputation for spiritual efficacy grew alongside its ability to help the community.\n\nToday, the Man Mo Temple remains one of Hong Kong’s most beloved and 'spiritually powerful' temples. It’s especially popular with students who visit to offer incense and touch the Wenchang pen, hoping to boost their academic success. Legend has it that those who do might achieve perfect test scores, graduate with top honors, or even win a Nobel Prize—perhaps one day changing the world!\n\nBeyond worshipping the deities, visitors can also draw fortune sticks. However, interpreting the sticks can be tricky, as the oracle isn’t always available, and language barriers may exist. Fortunately, the temple shop sells fortune stick sets with English interpretation books, making it easier for visitors to understand their fortunes and take charge of their destinies.",

          "Hong Kong Island’s mountainous terrain posed a challenge for development. To adapt, the British terraced the slopes and built stone retaining walls. In the cracks of these stone walls, Chinese Banyan trees took root and thrived. Mistaking them for holly trees, the British named this road 'Hollywood Road'—a name coined long before the famous Hollywood in the United States.\n\nIn January 1967, a boundary stone was discovered on Shek Pai Wan Road inscribed with 'Kwun Dai Road' (群帶路). This confirmed the existence of an ancient path that ran along the foothills of Victoria Peak, connecting the northern coast of Hong Kong Island to Aberdeen in the south. After the British troops landed in 1841, they extended this ancient road near Possession Point, creating the first major east-west route in the City of Victoria. (Contrary to popular belief, Queen’s Road wasn’t completed or named until after the signing of the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842.) Hollywood Road stretched from Sai Ying Pun in the west to Victoria Gaol in the east, serving as an important military thoroughfare in its early years.\n\nDuring the early colonial period, foreign merchants and British soldiers sold crafts and antiques looted from China on nearby Lascar Rows. As fortunes were made from the collapse of the Qing Empire, many antique dealers upgraded and moved their shops to the swankier Hollywood Road. To this day, the area is home to art galleries, antique stores, and auction houses. Classic Hong Kong movies often depict antique dealers as thieves among thieves who deal in stolen national treasures. It’s easy to imagine that 'crouching tigers' and 'hidden dragons' still reside on this historic street.\n\nIn 2024, Hollywood Road earned a global spotlight when Time Out magazine named this 180-year-old street the second most stylish street in the world, a well-deserved distinction.",

          "In the early days of British rule, apartheid policies were enforced to create an exclusive European environment for colonial settlers. Local Chinese residents were prohibited from living above Caine Road in the Mid-Levels or running businesses east of Aberdeen Street. This street became the dividing line between the foreign settlers in Central and the Chinese community in Sheung Wan. The streets and alleys of Sheung Wan reflect rich Chinese cultural traditions, while those beyond Aberdeen Street predominantly bear European names. Many of these names commemorate 'heroes,' symbolizing British power and dominance during the colonial era.\n\nAberdeen Street is named after George Hamilton-Gordon, the 4th Earl of Aberdeen, who served as British Foreign Secretary in 1840. He was celebrated as a 'Hero of the Empire' for successfully pressuring the Qing government to cede Hong Kong to Great Britain.\n\nInterestingly, when 'Aberdeen' was translated into Cantonese, a colonial-era Chinese administrator chose the word 'Ngap,' meaning 'duck,' instead of the usual 'Ah.' This made the Cantonese name sound like \"duck daddy crazy\" and was believed to be a subtle act of defiance against British rule.",

          "Elgin Street is named after James Bruce, the 8th Earl of Elgin, infamous for his role in the Second Opium War and for pioneering the brutal tactic of 'carpet bombing.' \n\nIn 1857, Bruce commanded British gunboats to bombard Guangzhou continuously for 72 hours. Over three days and nights, the relentless widespread artillery assault claimed countless Cantonese lives, leaving rivers of blood and devastation in its wake. Only after this carnage did British and French forces dare to enter the city.\n\nIn 1860, Bruce led another campaign with 18,000 British and French troops in Beijing. He ordered the looting of the city and the annihilation of the Old Summer Palace—a 16-hectare masterpiece that took over 150 years to craft. The once-grand palace was reduced to rubble after only three days and nights of fire.\n\nAround the same time, the British were developing the area above Hollywood Road, and Elgin Street was formed to connect to Caine Road at the Mid-level. During heavy rains, mud would wash down from the Peak, earning it the local nickname 'Mud Street.' For many, this name reflected their disdain for the 'Hero of the Empire,' who destroyed Guangzhou and Beijing and forced the Qing government to cede the Kowloon Peninsula.\n\nLet's cleanse the bitter taste of history by stopping at Kung Lee Sugar Cane Drink. Established in 1948 and housed in a century-old tenement building, this shop offers freshly steamed and pressed sugarcane juice that’s both soothing and sweet, made with a traditional process. With over 70 years of history, Kung Lee brings an 'old Hong Kong' flavor to its products, making it one of Central's best-value must-try street snacks.",

          'If the streets of Central with English names symbolize British colonial exploitation, then the egg tarts at Tai Cheong symbolize their colonial values.\n\nIn 1992, Chris Patten, the last Governor of Hong Kong, arrived with an unconventional approach to governance. Known for his savvy publicity stunts, he visited Tai Cheong on Lyndhurst Terrace and was photographed devouring egg tarts. This carefully staged "political show" became an instant hit. Dubbed "Fat Pang" by the locals, Patten\'s egg tart moment marked a notable departure from the iron-fisted colonial rule of his predecessors. The media frenzy boosted his popularity so much that it served as a bargaining chip in his negotiations with Beijing. Some say it was the political stunt with the highest ROI in our history.\n\nMany in Hong Kong remember Patten fondly as a champion of democracy, a "man of the people" who eats egg tarts and sips herbal tea like a local. In contrast, Beijing views this "Last Governor" as a villain who undermined the Sino-British agreement and hindered the actual progress of democracy.\n\nThe original Tai Cheong Bakery was across the street from its current store. In 2005, the high rent of Central forced its closure. Surprisingly, it quickly reopened in this new location after the Tao Heung Group acquired and transformed it into a chain. Whether the egg tarts taste the same is a question only Fat Pang could answer, but one thing is sure—the photos of him gobbling them are no longer on display.\n\nToday, tourists may recognize "Tai Cheong" as a famous Hong Kong brand, but few know its colonial aftertaste. The bakery still stands, countless sunsets have come and gone, and its egg tarts continue to delight food lovers. The good and the bad, the rights and the wrongs—now all distant memories to savor with tea and pastries.',

          "The famous Latin phrase 'traduttore, traditore'—'translator, traitor'—captures the inherent imprecision of translation. It can also be interpreted literally as 'translation is rebellion,' an idea embraced by many early Chinese administrators in the Hong Kong colonial government.\n\nTake Pottinger Street, for example, named after British soldier Henry Pottinger, a key figure in the First Opium War. Pottinger led the British forces from Hong Kong to Shanghai and forced the Qing Government to sign the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842 on behalf of the British Empire. He later was appointed Hong Kong’s first governor. Early colonial records show his Cantonese name as '煲顛茶,' which roughly means \"Claypot Upside-Down Tea\" or \"making a pot of crazy tea.\" This must have been a comical translation intended as an insult.\n\nPottinger Street’s history is as layered as its steps. The original steep upper sections of the road were nicknamed 'Stone Slab Street' because it was paved with stone slabs designed to help pedestrians navigate the hilly terrain. Over time, the street extended toward the Victoria Harbour on reclaimed land, providing a vehicular connection between Queen’s Road Central and Connaught Road Central. While the newer sections cater to modern development, the older stepped sections retain their unique charm. They are now a bustling tourist destination with stalls selling souvenirs and costumes and offering a beautiful setting for photos.\n\nAnd here’s a curious side story: during Trump’s first presidency, one of his key national security aids, Matt Pottinger, lived on Pottinger Street while working as a reporter in Hong Kong. Could he be related to Henry Pottinger, Hong Kong’s first governor? It’s a funny thought to ponder as you wander down this historic street.",

          'What was one of the first public facilities built after the British occupation of Hong Kong Island in 1841? Answer: A prison. \n\nThe former Central Police Station complex, locally known as Tai Kwun, meaning "the largest police station," began as Victoria Gaol—the first British-style building in Hong Kong. Its strategic connection to Sai Ying Pun (Western Barracks) and Admiralty Barracks symbolized the colonial government\'s strict control over the local Chinese population during its early days.\n\nThe Central Police Station was decommissioned in 2004, followed by Victoria Prison in 2006. After 12 years of dereliction, planning, conservation, and construction, 100% over-budget but still completely funded by the Hong Kong Jockey Club, "Tai Kwun" finally re-opened in May 2018 as a premiere cultural and arts center. While the revitalized Tai Kwun highlights its historical role in establishing the rule of law, it conveniently overlooks its darker history, such as the annual public floggings and hangings within its walls.\n\nUrban renewal in Hong Kong tells a fascinating story. Historic Chinese districts like Sheung Wan have been almost erased by relentless gentrification. Yet, ironically, conservation efforts thrive in Central, where space is even more precious. Many neglected buildings have been preserved under the banner of heritage, but not all have found meaningful purpose. Lacking better ideas, centers like Tai Kwun and PMQ often feel like idealistic showcases that sideline practical urban needs.\n\nSo, what will you choose? Will you join an official guided group tour of Tai Kwun, or will you explore, at your own pace, the historical streets of Sheung Wan filled with insightful local stories curated by our ManyRoads app? It\'s a choice not just for tourists but for the future of Hong Kong\'s development of cultural tourism.',

          'This neoclassical building, a red-brick facade with accented bands of white plaster, was built in 1892 as a cold storage facility for the Dairy Farm Company (not to be confused with the "Ice House" on Ice House Street). In the early 1980s, the British Hong Kong government approved its repurposing, granting it to the Fringe Club and the Foreign Correspondents\' Club at a rental far below market value—an arrangement that continues today. \r\n\r\nThe Fringe Club, named after the "Edinburgh Festival Fringe," is Hong Kong\'s oldest cultural and arts center, open to the public and steeped in history. Meanwhile, the Foreign Correspondents\' Club was originally an exclusive social club for foreign journalists. Today, it includes many local Hong Kong members, but a controversial policy persists: "local" members have only half the voting rights of their "foreign" counterparts. Urban legends claim that during Hong Kong\'s 1997 handover to China, the club doubled as a hub for intelligence agents and foreign operatives posing as journalists or artists. The building, it\'s said, briefly became a spy outpost in the Far East.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the Hong Kong Journalists Association, representing local media professionals, has never pushed for a dedicated space for Hong Kong journalists within the club. Nor has it challenged the preferential treatment of foreign members. This peculiar arrangement raises an intriguing question in the post-colonial era: Why doesn\'t Hong Kong have its own "Hong Kong Correspondents\' Club"?',

          "Duddell Street is a charming vehicular lane and stairs connecting Queen's Road Central and Ice House Street. Its iconic stone steps, flanked by four gas lamps on stone corner pedestals, hold the distinction of being Hong Kong's only remaining operational gas lamps. Maintained by the Hong Kong and China Gas Company, these lamps light up every evening from 6 pm to 6 am the next morning, adding a warm, historic glow to the area. Both the steps and the gas lamps are designated statutory monuments, symbolizing a bygone era.\n\nDespite whispers of ghost stories, Duddell Street's unique vintage charm has made it a sought-after filming location for TV dramas and movies and a picturesque spot for wedding photos.  \n\nThe street's name honors British merchants Frederick and George Duddell, who were active in southern China during the \"Canton Thirteen Factories\" trading era. At one point, they even attempted to cultivate a coffee plantation in Causeway Bay. However, after their business ventures failed, the brothers returned to England, where they lived out their remaining years.  \n\nToday, Duddell Street blends history, nostalgia, and allure, offering visitors a glimpse into Hong Kong's colonial past.

          "Walking from Sheung Wan to the Landmark, you will begin to feel the pulse of Hong Kong’s Central Business District. With every step you take, every lot, and every towering building you pass, the core interests of Hong Kong’s ruling class are revealed.\n\nJardine Matheson, a powerful British trading company, played a pivotal role behind the scenes in the Opium Wars. In 1841, during the British flag-raising ceremony at Possession Point (where our tour began), its founders, James Matheson and William Jardine, were among the select few foreign merchants in attendance.\n\nOver time, as Central developed into Hong Kong’s commercial hub, foreign merchants like Jardine Matheson concentrated their businesses here. The company’s property division, Hongkong Land, now owns one of the largest real estate portfolios in the area, supported by rare 999-year leases—privileges granted only to the inner circle among the British merchants in colonial times.\n\nSince William Keswick became Jardine’s Taipan (Managing Director) in 1874, the Keswick family has guided the company’s growth across five generations, earning widespread acclaim. Yet, the family’s dark origins in the opium trade and smuggling are rarely remembered and seldom mentioned anymore.\n\nCentral’s urban renewal often faces opposition, where old buildings are kept long after their purpose or revitalized as centers of art and culture instead of needed commercial spaces. One can’t help but wonder if Jardine Matheson’s enduring influence as the largest property owner in the area plays a role in shaping the district’s development—or lack thereof.\n\n(This would be an excellent time to take a bathroom break in the swankiest mall in Hong Kong)",

          "(Queen's) Statue Square, originally known as Royal Square, was constructed on land reclaimed from Victoria Harbour in the 1880s. In 1887, to celebrate The Golden Jubilee, marking the 50th anniversary of Queen Victoria's accession to the throne, the colonial government unveiled a bronze statue of the Queen prominently placed in the center of the square. It created a symbolic central axis with the first-generation Queen's Pier.\n\nDuring World War II, when Hong Kong fell under Japanese 3-year and 8-month occupation, many bronze statues, including Queen Victoria's, were confiscated, melted down, and reforged into weapons of war.\n\nAfter the war, the bronze statue of Sir Thomas Jackson, the chief manager of HSBC Bank, was relocated to Statue Square. In the 1960s and 70s, people often mysteriously disappeared near the square. According to folklore, the bronze statue of Sir Jackson would leap from its high pedestal at night to consume his victims. The police had no idea how or why these disappearances were occurring. Eventually, they resorted to spending significant money to hire a Chinese shaman to resolve the deadly mystery. The shaman ordered the installation of triangular stone spikes at the statue's base to \"prevent Sir Johnson from jumping down.\" Miraculously, no one has disappeared ever since, and no one knows why.",

          '"HSBC" was formerly known as "Hong Kong & Shanghai Bank Corp." No matter how its name changes, it still maintains its roots in Hong Kong and Shanghai. Its bank development, from late Qing Dynasty Shanghai to today\'s Hong Kong SAR, forms a large part of modern Chinese financial history. \n\nBefore 1997, HSBC was the most influential enterprise in Hong Kong, possessing the powers of a central bank without the usual obligations, making it indeed a "money-printing" bank. Therefore, among the wisdom of retail investors: "the dumbest people put their money in "HSBC" accounts, while the smartest only buy "HSBC" stocks."\n\nAfter the 1997 handover, HSBC made a conscious choice to relocate its registration to the United Kingdom and rebrand into "The World\'s Local Bank" to expand aggressively globally. However, its acquisition of "Household" in the United States during the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis caused tremendous losses. Since then, "HSBC" has refocused its efforts on Asia.\n\nThe bank\'s headquarters at No. 1 Queen\'s Road Central has the BEST address in Hong Kong, with a lease stipulating that no structure can ever block its view of Victoria Harbour. Li Ka-Shing, Hong Kong\'s wealthiest tycoon, received significant support from HSBC during the negotiations on the future of Hong Kong. He secured backing for acquiring the land and constructing his company\'s headquarters, Cheung Kong Center. But despite all his wealth, power, and influence, Cheung Kong Center could only get assigned the No. 2 Queen\'s Road Central address.\n\nWhether these leading enterprises at No. 1 and No. 2 Queen\'s Road Central are, in actuality, British or Hong Kong SAR entities continues to spark lively debates over business lunches in the financial sector.',

          'The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Building, completed in 1912, was originally the Supreme Court, earning the nickname "Big Court." In 1980, it became the Legislative Council building, but after the Government Headquarters in Tamar was built, it returned to its judicial role as the Court of Final Appeal.\n\nThe most striking feature of the Big Court is its grand perimeter arcade, supported by smooth stone columns that reach a height of 17 meters. However, what often captures our attention is the statue of "Themis," the Goddess of Justice, which stands above the central entrance. The building\'s design includes several additional meanings that are less obvious: at the very top of the central dome, which rises above the Chinese-style tiled roofs, is not a lightning rod but the "Crown of Tudor," symbolizing the supreme authority of the British monarchy. The triangular pediment beneath Themis is also adorned with royal emblems and features the inscription "DIEU ET MON DROIT," which translates to "My Right is Divine."\n\nUnder British rule, if a case was lost in the Hong Kong Supreme Court, an appeal could be made to His Majesty\'s Most Honourable Privy Council in the UK. Today, with no further appeal option, the Court of Final Appeal serves as Hong Kong\'s highest judicial body, truly living up to its name "Big Court."\n\nDespite the handover, Hong Kong continues to follow the Common Law System, with a British royal crown still prominently displayed in its highest judicial institution. While replacing it with a Chinese plaque like that of the famous Judge Bao might be excessive, it\'s worth asking: "Should British royal authority sit above the Goddess of Justice in Hong Kong?"',

          "In traditional Chinese society, social networking often revolves around \"clans,\" but for the British, it's all about \"clubs.\" To truly understand the power dynamics of British colonial governance, you have to decode the relationships within these clubs.\n\nOlder generations in Hong Kong used to joke that the hierarchy of power was: the Jockey Club at the top, followed by HSBC, and then the Governor. However, insiders of colonial power would tell a different story. Back then, the most influential institution wasn't the Jockey Club—but The Hong Kong Club. Located in Central, Hong Kong's most prestigious district, the Jockey Club only has a couple of betting stations, while The Hong Kong Club (don't forget the \"The\") has occupied the prime spot since the city's beginning. Anyone with enough wealth could become a horse-owner member of the Jockey Club, but The Hong Kong Club membership is extremely exclusive, limited to just 1,500 people in the city of 7 million. To join, you need recommendations from current members, then invited to apply, undergo multiple committee interviews, and be voted in.\n\nThe club's clubhouse sits in the heart of Hong Kong's colonial power center, surrounded by other elite institutions like HSBC, Jardine, City Hall, and the Supreme Court, with views of Statue Square and Victoria Harbour. Before 1997, the club was dominated by Anglo elites, making it an inner sanctum of Hong Kong's social, political, and economic power. Today, how The Hong Kong Club represents Hong Kong's political and economic status is worth further exploration.",

          "Queen's Road originally ran along the northern coast of Hong Kong Island. After a devastating fire in Sheung Wan in 1851, debris from the fire was used for the first land reclamation, expanding the Sheung Wan coastline north to Bonham Strand and the Central coast to Des Voeux Road. Over the following decades, this reclamation continued, reaching Connaught Road, where the first Queen's Pier was built in 1925. After World War II, another major reclamation project began. In 1954, the pier was replaced with a new one located on the newly reclaimed Victoria Harbourfront (between Lung Wo Road and City Hall today.)\n\nThis second-generation Queen's Pier became the ceremonial dock for British officials and royal family members visiting Hong Kong. From 1958, starting with Sir Robert Brown Black, every new governor arrived aboard the yacht \"Lady Maurine,\" dressed in full colonial attire, and participated in a welcome ceremony and military parade at Edinburgh Place before taking the oath of office at City Hall.\n\nThe pier itself wasn't architecturally remarkable, but after Hong Kong's sovereignty was returned, it became a popular spot for fishing enthusiasts and couples to make out. In the 2000s, as part of the Central Reclamation project, the SAR government proposed demolishing the pier, sparking outrage among conservationists who argued it was an important part of Hong Kong's cultural heritage and collective memory. Despite the protests, the pier was ultimately demolished in 2007.\n\nSince then, there's been no royal palace on Queen's Road East, no royal statue in Statue Square, and no royal ships docking at Queen's Pier.",

          'The area around the Hong Kong SAR Government Headquarters at 2 Tim Mei Avenue and the adjacent Tamar Park is known by older locals as "Tamar Warship." This name originates from the British troopship "HMS Tamar," named after the River Tamar in southwest England.\n\nThe HMS Tamar was tasked with transporting troops across the globe to support the British Empire\'s colonial expansion. After its maiden voyage in 1864, it made two trips to Hong Kong to rotate British troops. By 1897, it had been refitted as a supply ship for the Hong Kong naval dockyard, losing its ability for long-distance navigation. Permanently moored off Admiralty in Victoria Harbour, the HMS Tamar served as the headquarters for the commander of the British Navy\'s China Fleet and even hosted many parties. During World War II, when defending Hong Kong became hopeless, the British Navy scuttled all non-combatant ships, including the HMS Tamar, to prevent their capture by the invading Japanese forces. Its sinking marked a sad chapter in the proud history of the Royal Navy. \n\nOn June 30, 1997, history came full circle as the last Governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, bid farewell to the colony from Tamar Dockyard. On that day, a gentle breeze and light rain set the scene as the British farewell ceremony concluded. Among the dignitaries were the Admiral of the Fleet, The Prince of Wales (now King Charles III), and Governor Patten, who boarded the royal yacht HMY Britannia and waved goodbye. Patten\'s three daughters wept as the yacht departed, marking the end of the 156-year British colonial era in Hong Kong.\n\nToday, the wreckage of the HMS Tamar rests quietly on the seabed off Wan Chai in Victoria Harbour, slowly rusting away, largely forgotten.',

      "Join us on a journey through the British colonial history of Hong Kong. We'll start in Sheung Wan and make our way to Central, beginning in the historic City of Victoria, established by the British in the early days of their colonial occupation, and ending at Victoria Harbour, where Hong Kong’s last Governor departed in 1997 aboard the HMY Britannia.\n\nAs we move from the western district to the bustling heart of Hong Kong Island, we’ll explore the transition from old to new. Along the way, we’ll navigate historic neighborhoods, stroll down iconic streets, and uncover the stories behind significant buildings and local memories.\n\nBy the end of this journey, you’ll gain a fresh perspective and a new understanding of how this 'Asia’s World City.' came to be.",

      "Renowned as the father of the Chinese revolutions of the last century and one of the founders of the Republic of China, Dr Sun Yat-sen is an important figure in modern Chinese history. The Dr Sun Yat-sen Historical Trail not only commemorates the formative years Dr Sun spent in Hong Kong but also his historical legacy and achievements.\r\n\r\nDr Sun arrived in Hong Kong during his teens. Throughout the next nine years he received secondary and tertiary education here, and made friends with many who shared his political persuasions and aspirations. Committed to strengthening the nation for the betterment of the people, they eventually staged uprisings to overthrow the Qing government.\r\n\r\nHong Kong provided much inspiration for Sun’s ideas. Most of his activities at that time were based in Central and Western District. The places on the following trail all featured in those formative years, and the plaques are designed by local artists to showcase the rich history and culture of the city.",
